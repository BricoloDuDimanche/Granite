A powerful, intuitive and easy to use client for [Andesite](https://github.com/natanbc/andesite-node) & JDA 4

**Note**: project in early stages of development, so it is neither distributed nor working for now. Soon!

## todo

 - [ ] Make the client actually able to communicate with Andesite
 - [ ] Queue management through Granite itself
 - [ ] Load balancing (based on nodes load)
 - [ ] Add region factor to load balancing (EU traffic to EU nodes, US traffic to US nodes)
 - [ ] Automatic failover if a node is available (preferably in region)
 - [ ] Automatically switch node when region is updated (if a better one is available)
 - [ ] SSL Support
